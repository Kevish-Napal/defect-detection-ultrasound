# Defect Detection with Ultrasound

This MATLAB code performs non-destructive testing of heterogeneous materials using ultrasound to detect and localize defects such as cracks. Ultrasound wave scattering is simulated in FreeFem++ (a C++ Finite Element Method solver), and the resulting data is analyzed using the Differential Linear Sampling Method to identify structural anomalies within the material.
